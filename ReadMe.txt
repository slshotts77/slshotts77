The site is aesthetically pleasing overall and is tailored in a way that exhibits your unique professional personality.
The site uses HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap to properly divide content and to account for a variety of devices. Bootstrap templates are ok to use, but they should be tailored in a way that is unique to you. (We shouldn’t be able to recognize the template).
The CSS styling goes beyond the minimal components(e.g., background color and font color), and provides an engaging user experience.
The site is highly navigable with its buttons. All buttons are functioning properly and even have features that accentuate the texture of the buttons.
The site has thumbnails with links that show examples of work you’ve built in this course. These will include samples or links to Repl.it projects, Codepen.io projects, your Store Project, and any projects you've done in the past or on the side. Essentially, these are links that showcase your original work.
The site provides detailed information for employers to contact you, including LinkedIn and GitHub info/buttons.
The site also has a working contact form using Formspree.io.
The portfolio has an about feature that tells your story as a developer and professional.
The site is free of spelling errors and typos.
The site has been completed in a timely fashion.
Your resume should be included and downloadable.
The site is deployed to GitHub pages.
The project should be deployed under your 'handle.github.io' link
